# Question #2
#
# You have a given picture with size w√óh. Determine if the given picture has a single "+" shape or not.
# A "+" shape is described below:
#
# 1. A "+" shape has one center nonempty cell.
# 2. There should be some (at least one) consecutive non-empty cells in each direction from the center.
#    In other words, there should be a ray in each direction.
# 3. All other cells are empty.

# Find out if the given picture has single "+" shape.
